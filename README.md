# ReactionTime
My sister asked me to help her make a bar graph... I went a little overboard :)
The starting dataset (rt_acc_averages.xlsx) is small so it could have been easily cleaned up in excel, 
but I wanted to show how I can clean and merge a dataset in a reproducible manner
and create interactive graphs for exploratory analysis.

diff = difficulty (1=easy, 2=medium, 3=hard)

reward = 1 = no reward, 2 = reward

group = disorder type
